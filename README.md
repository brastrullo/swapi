### Objective:
    Using SWAPI.co, build a React/Redux app that lists the characters from the Star Wars series.

### Features:
    - Each line should display the character's name, birth year, height, and mass
    - The list is paginated with basic next/prev buttons
    - After every 8th character, insert the name of a spaceship from Star Wars (don't repeat spaceships)

### Requirements:
    - ES6
    - All data and state stored in Redux
    - Tested (any test framework)
    - Fetch API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
    - (React Router) Clicking the name of the character brings you to a character view page with more information on the character
    - A basic 'loading' state/indicator when making api calls
    - Commits to Git to indicate progress

### Bonus Points:
    - Basic styling via Emotion CSS (inline)
    - SSR
    - Pagination is handled via scrolling
    - Use only functional components and React "hooks" for lifecycle features
